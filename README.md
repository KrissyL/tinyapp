# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).
All shortened URLs can be accessed by anyone as long as they have the exact link. The app is user specific, so although anyone can see the URLs, only valid users can create, edit and delete their own urls.

## Final Product
